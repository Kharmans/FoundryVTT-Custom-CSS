# Custom CSS Rules

Allows a user to define custom CSS rules in a world!

## What problem does this solve?

When adding a lot of modules, every now and then they don't quite agree with each other on where things should live. A small amount of CSS can fix this, but manually patching CSS in the server or writing a local module is a pain. This module allows you to quickly and easily enter per-world CSS rules to make these tweaks instead.

## What about other possibilities?

Well, perhaps you've tried all those new-fangled deluxe content modules and developed a taste for the finder things in Foundry Journals? Now's your change to make your own bespoke journal style! The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. Okay... and your knowledge of CSS... but what better way to learn?

## Changelog

## v2.3.1
Now under new management!
Many thanks to everyone who got the module this far.
I'm going to focus for now on just trying to keep the lights on.
